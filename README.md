# Machine-Learning-Project--Video-Games-Sales-Predictor

- This project is all about of The Machine Learning model to predict future sales of Video Games in global market. We will learn different patterns and relationships between the input Variables or factors that affecting to the video games sales. We analyse data to get meaningfull information from them and Visualize to recognise different patterns among them and showing meaning full information that will help us to predict sales data by creating effective machine learning model. We use Data set which contains the list of video games with sales greater than 16500 games in global market. 

# Project Structure:-
Project comprises of following Analysis Methods and ML techniques :-
- Exploratory data anaylysis 
- Data preprocessing
- Data Cleanning and Manipulation
- Data Visualization
- Feature scaling
- Feature Selection
- Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
- Effective machine Learning Model
- Hyper parameters with Different Techniques

# Machine Learning Algorithms used:
- Linear Regression
- KNN Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vectot Regressor

# Material used to build Machine Learning App
- Programming Language :- Python
- Libraries used:- Streamlit , Pandas , Matplotlib,Seaborn,Numpy,ScikitLearn etc.

# Web App:
I have developed web app that shows project analysis, Visualization in effective manner with the help of Streamlit an open-source Python library.And finally we can predict sales of Video games by just one click. This Data science techniques understandable by non programmer also.
